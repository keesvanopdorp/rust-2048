## How to run the project

- Be sure that you have Rust and Cargo installed you can it install it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
    
    - To check if you have Rust and Cargo installed you can run `rustc --version` or `cargo --version` 

- open a Terminal and run `3cargo run` to build and run a debug build and `cargo run --release` to build and run a release build

    - **`cargo run` wil automatically install and build all the project dependencies.**
